# RockMineClassification
I used logistic regression for this classification ,also the dataset was almost balanced interms of number of rocks and mines, also all 59 features here lied in between 0-1 ,so did a 80:20 split and achieved 83% accuracy on training and 76% accuracy on test data.But I must say dataset was very clean with no null value or outlier making it easy.
